# clmc

#What is it?
This is an enhanced version of the Little Man Computer (LMC) simulation.

It is written in Python using the tkinter GUI toolkit.

#Why is it here?
The purpose was to extend LMC so that I could teach the different addressing modes required in the old OCR A level spec.  I then added animation to cover the architecture part of the same spec.  It has been updated to reflect the new OCR spec and also had some additions to make it usable by teachers of AQA A level as well.

I previously published an Excel version of this (inspired by Bryan Pizzey's Excel LMC) as Computing At School's resource 4148.

The research about teaching programming says students who do not progress typically either do not have a mental machine model or do not understand the next layer of abstraction below the one they are working at.  This simulator comes out every time I need to address (sorry!) those things.

#How do I use it?
To use it: download all the files here into a folder on your computer; open clmc.py in IDLE and press F5!

There are code samples included in the repo - I plan to produce videos showing how to use these.

Licensing information is in the comments at the top of the source code.

If you use it, drop me an email - I'm sure you'll find bugs or ideas for improvement which I'd like to make.  That's why it's here on github and not still on my memory stick ...
